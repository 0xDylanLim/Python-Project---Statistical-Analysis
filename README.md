This project involves the use of hypothesis testing on a given dataset.

You are a data professional in a data consulting firm, called Automatidata. The current project for their newest client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) is reaching its midpoint, having completed a project proposal, Python coding work, and exploratory data analysis.

You receive a new email from Uli King, Automatidataâ€™s project manager. Uli tells your team about a new request from the New York City TLC: to analyze the relationship between fare amount and payment type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: Deshawn Washington, Luana Rodriguez, and Udo Bankole. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. A final email from Luana includes your specific assignment: to conduct an A/B test.
